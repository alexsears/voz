# Voz project configuration
# Copy this file to projects.yaml and edit with your projects:
#   cp projects.example.yaml projects.yaml
#
# Or just talk to Voz — say "add project my-app at ~/code/my-app"
# and it will configure everything for you.
#
# Paths should use WSL format: /mnt/c/code/... (not C:\code\...)
